Feature: Running a test
  As an iOS developer
  I want to have a sample feature file
  So I can begin testing quickly

Scenario: Example steps
  Given I am on the Welcome Screen
  Then I touch the "Count Up" button
  Then I touch the "Count Up" button
  And I wait until I don't see "Please swipe left"
  And take picture
